# OCR_SAD

**OCR_SAD** (Smart Accurate Document OCR) is a project designed to address a common challenge in document processing: extracting text from PDFs or images **while preserving the original layout and structure**.

Most traditional OCR tools focus on recognizing characters accurately, but often ignore how the content is visually organized. As a result, the output may lose important formatting elements such as tables, columns, headings, and spacing â€” which are essential for documents like forms, invoices, research papers, and reports.
